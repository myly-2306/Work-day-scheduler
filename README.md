# Work-day-scheduler


An application that helps users manage events within a day during business hour.

On the top of the scheduler, it displays current date and time running by seconds.

The body of the page contains time slots from 8am in the morning to 5pm afternoon. Each time slot has a text area to type in event, appointment, things to do and next to it is a save button to save the text.

Time slots are color coded to differentiate past, present and future which past is grey, present is red, future is green.

When hit save, text is saved in local browser storage. After users refresh browser, saved events on each time slot still present.

All the time slots are grey because they are pasted current time.
